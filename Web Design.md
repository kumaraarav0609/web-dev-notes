## Colour Theory

### What Does Each Color Represent?

- When you are picking colours to use for your website, you don't just randomly pick or choose which color you like. You pick the best colour based on the "mood" of your website. 
- Each colour represents a different theme to humans according to psychological studies.

### Color Palettes

- You would usually have more than one colour in your website instead of having just a single one.

#### Analogous Colours

- Two colours that are right next to each other on the color palette are analogous colours.
- They look harmonious together.
- They are good for things like the navbar, body or logo of your website.
- It's not very good at popping out.

#### Complementary Colours

- Two colours that are right opposite to each other on the color palette are complementary colours.
- It's very good at popping out.
- It should not be used for things like text as it strains the viewers eyes.
- Instead it should be used for things like logos or icons which you want  to stand out together.

#### How to Find Colour Palettes?

- Two websites that are useful for this:
    - [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) is good for creating your own palettes.
    - [Colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/) is good for finding premade color palettes.

## Typography

### Main Font Types

- There are two main types of fonts:
    - Serif (Letters have feet at the bottom)
        - It looks serious, old, and authorative.
        - It is good for things like (just a few examples):
            - A letterhead for a legal company
            - A magazine for architectural design
    - Sans-serif (Letters don't have feet and are perfect right angles)
        - It looks sensible, simple, and straightforward.
        - It is good for things like (just a few examples):
            - Startup websites

### Combining Fonts

- It is recommended to use only 2 fonts in your website.
- They should have a similar mood and time era to each other.
- They should have different serif-ness and weights.

## UI (User Interface)

### Hierarchy

![hierachy](<assets/Images/Web Design/hierachy.png>)

- In the first invite the important and the less important ones all look the same and therefore have the same hierarachy.
- However, the second one has bigger font sizes and different given to the important bits.

#### Colour

![color-hierarchy-example](<assets/Images/Web Design/color-hierarchy-example.png>)

- In this page, the outlet section of the navbar is red and the add to bag button is green and different compared to everything else.
- This is so your attention is diverted to these two things so that they can make more money from you.

#### Size

![size-hierarchy-example](<assets/Images/Web Design/size-hierarchy-example.png>)

- The first thing that you are drawn into is the text saying "Buy and sell cryptocurrency" as it is the biggest.
- The next thing you would be drawn to is the email address bar and the "Get Started" button.
- This is because of the sizes of the items.

#### Layout

![layout-hierarchy-example](<assets/Images/Web Design/layout-hierarchy-example.png>)

- I think this is self-explanatory.

### Alignment

![alignment-example](<assets/Images/Web Design/alignment-example.png>)

- Having less grid lines is better as it makes your page look less sloppy.
- The more aligned elements are, the better.

### White Space

- It refers to the empty space around your text and elements.

![white-space-example](<assets/Images/Web Design/white-space-example.png>)

- You can see that in the first image everything looks cluttered and makes the product look cheap whereas the second image there is lots of empty space around the headphone image making it look luxurious.

### Audience

![audience-example](<assets/Images/Web Design/audience-example.png>)

- The first image lacks punch and is very boring which would not attract the target audience, which is children.
- The second image is very bold and fun looking which would attract its target audience, children.

## UX (User Experience)

- A website with good user experience will make the user feel like everything is effortless.

### Simplicity

![simplicity-example](<assets/Images/Web Design/simplicity-example.png>)

- This webpage is a good example of simplicity.
- It is not very cluttered with many things to focus on therefore easing the user's mind.

### Consistency

![consistency-example](<assets/Images/Web Design/consistency-example.png>)

- In this website, each page has different layouts and looks.
- This is inconvenient for users.

### Reading Patterns

- There are two common patterns that humans use to read.
- You should try to use either while creating a website.

#### F Pattern

![f-pattern](<assets/Images/Web Design/f-pattern.png>)

#### Z Pattern

![z-pattern](<assets/Images/Web Design/z-pattern.png>)

### All Platforms Design

- When creating websites keep in mind all platforms.
- A website should look good on both mobile and desktop.
